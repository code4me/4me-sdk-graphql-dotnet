Also use this relation type to link a virtual machine, software distribution package or software CI to the physical computers on which it has been installed. This relation type is also used to link a hardware CI to the hardware CI that it is a component of, installed in, or directly connected to (not using the network). In case of an address CI, this relation type is used to create a link with the CI to which the address has been assigned.</br>

Also use this relation type to link a physical computer to the virtual machines, software distribution packages or software CIs that have been installed on it. This relation type is also used to link a hardware CI to its hardware components, CIs that have been installed in it, and CIs that are directly connected to it (not using the network). It is also used to link the addresses that have been assigned to it.</br>
